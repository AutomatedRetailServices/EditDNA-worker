# CutSell.ai — Canonical Decision Log

Current product generation: **CutSell.ai 7**.

This file records product and Brain decisions that agents and engineers must treat as current unless a later decision explicitly supersedes them.

## Status vocabulary

- **CANONICAL** — current product truth.
- **SUPERSEDED** — was once valid, but a later decision replaced it.
- **REJECTED** — explicitly not allowed.
- **POST-BETA** — valid future scope, but must not block the current beta.

## D-001 — Flow B before Flow A
**Status: CANONICAL**

Flow B ships first. Flow A remains part of CutSell but follows after the Flow B core is stable.

## D-002 — Clean Cut first
**Status: CANONICAL**

CutSell must first understand and clean the raw recording before commercial composition. Clean Cut owns production cleanup: failed takes, false starts, dead air, fumbles, retry debris, boundary issues and related recording mistakes.

## D-003 — Clean Cut cannot delete valid speech for commercial reasons
**Status: CANONICAL**

Commercial labels such as Hook, Benefit, Proof, Story or CTA are descriptive. Clean Cut must not delete otherwise valid speech merely because it is weak commercially or does not fit a sales slot. When uncertain about deletion, preserve valid speech.

## D-004 — Rigid sales funnel
**Status: SUPERSEDED**

A fixed `HOOK -> PROBLEM -> BENEFIT -> PROOF -> CTA` composition is no longer canonical.

Replaced by flexible sales/story understanding that discovers the strongest coherent narrative actually present in the footage.

## D-005 — Flexible funnel and storytelling
**Status: CANONICAL**

Sales Edit must recognize available functions such as hook, problem, discovery, product introduction, feature, benefit, demo, proof, testimonial, objection, result, story and CTA without requiring every function or a fixed order. Story continuity can dominate the edit.

## D-006 — Global-context editing
**Status: CANONICAL**

Master reasoning order:

**Understand globally -> decide locally with global context -> compose globally -> review globally.**

A locally good clip may still be wrong if it breaks chronology, duplicates a better take, kills momentum or damages narrative coherence.

## D-007 — No Frankenstein speech
**Status: REJECTED**

Do not create sentences the creator never delivered by stitching words or sentence fragments across distinct takes or source assets.

## D-008 — Immutable source identity
**Status: CANONICAL**

Every source asset and selected segment must retain deterministic source identity and source timestamps. Never merge identities between source assets.

## D-009 — Retry groups and Best Take
**Status: CANONICAL**

Retries are grouped by the same specific underlying communication attempt, even when wording changes. Best Take ranks valid alternatives using multimodal evidence and context. Best Take is a ranking authority, not a deletion authority.

## D-010 — Visual type is separate from semantic role
**Status: CANONICAL**

Visual presentation and commercial meaning are different dimensions.

Examples of visual type: talking head/headshot, product shot, demo, B-roll/lifestyle, screen recording, close-up, before/after.

Examples of semantic role: hook, problem, story, discovery, feature, benefit, proof, objection, result, CTA.

One segment may carry multiple semantic roles.

## D-011 — Storytelling is relational, not only classification
**Status: CANONICAL**

CutSell must preserve setup, progression, cause/effect, discovery, payoff and required context. Storytelling quality is not achieved merely by tagging a clip as STORY.

## D-012 — Editable Draft, not destructive final-only output
**Status: SUPERSEDED for Clean Cut Core V1 by D-019 (SWAP out of scope). Still CANONICAL for the editor/mobile-app layer's own manual controls (Restore, Remove, Reorder, Trim, Split, captions, text/overlays, audio, undo/redo) and for a future manual "swap take" editor feature, if reintroduced -- see D-019.**

AI output is an editable draft timeline. Selected clips appear in the draft; valid alternatives remain swappable; discarded production mistakes remain recoverable when appropriate. User controls include Swap Take, Restore, Remove, Reorder, Trim, Split, captions, text/overlays, audio and undo/redo.

## D-013 — Human-performance errors matter
**Status: CANONICAL**

A transcript can be linguistically complete and still be a failed take because of visible frustration, lost-line behavior, eye/camera disengagement, body reset, camera adjustment, product-handling mistake, visual fumble or recording-process behavior.

## D-014 — Preserve authentic personality
**Status: CANONICAL**

Do not classify authentic personality, intentional humor, normal mannerisms or meaningful reactions as recording mistakes merely because they are not optimized sales delivery.

## D-015 — Benchmark success is not quality success
**Status: CANONICAL**

A workflow completing successfully is necessary but insufficient. A benchmark only passes the editing-quality gate when the rendered output itself is judged postable under the current doctrine.

## D-016 — Flow A
**Status: POST-BETA**

Flow A remains on the same platform: product/script intake, script generation/editing, recording cards, teleprompter, multiple takes per card, then the same Watch + Listen / Clean Cut / Best Take / editable-draft pipeline.

## D-017 — Current beta priority
**Status: CANONICAL**

Current priority order:
1. Flow B Brain / Clean Cut editorial quality.
2. Flexible sales/story understanding and continuity.
3. Reliable editable mobile draft.
4. Physical iPhone validation.
5. Apple signing and closed TestFlight.

## D-018 — Spend and irreversible actions
**Status: CANONICAL**

Paid RunPod work, new paid infrastructure, production deployment, release merge, destructive legacy changes and Apple/TestFlight release actions require explicit user approval at their respective gates.

## D-019 — SWAP is out of scope for Clean Cut Core V1
**Status: CANONICAL**

Effective the Clean Cut Core V1 migration: SWAP is removed from the ACTIVE Clean Cut
decision path. The semantic membership model for Clean Cut Core V1 is SELECT/KEEP vs
DISCARD only -- there is no alternate-take inventory in the winning timeline. A
non-winning retry does not belong in the final edit and is excluded from it. The goal
is one coherent winning edit, not a winning edit plus alternate inventory.

This is a product-scope decision, not a technical limitation: alternate-take swapping
may return in a future version, another product layer, or an editor feature -- that
decision is explicitly deferred to the user. **SWAP IS OUT OF SCOPE FOR CLEAN CUT V1
UNTIL THE USER EXPLICITLY REINTRODUCES IT.**

Legacy SWAP machinery is not deleted, only deactivated for this path: `deterministic_
best_take_authority.py`'s `swap_enabled` parameter defaults to `False` (a legitimate
losing retry is DISCARDed, not parked as SWAP); the whole-video Unified Selection
reasoner (which natively reasons in SELECT/SWAP/DISCARD) is deactivated in the active
path via `clean_cut_core_v1_enabled` (default on) and kept only for rollback; render_
plan.py already renders `selected` only and was unaffected. `draft_edits.py`'s
`swap_take` (a manual, user-initiated mobile-editor operation, not an automatic
Selection decision) is a different product layer and was not touched by this decision.

## D-020 — Clean Cut Core V1: idea-first architecture
**Status: CANONICAL**

Clean Cut Core V1 reasons idea-first, not pairwise-first: complete intended ideas ->
all delivery attempts belonging to each idea -> quality/completeness competition ->
one winning delivery or a necessary composite -> KEEP/DISCARD. An offline audit of a
real run found that discovering retry families as an unranked, fixed-budget pairwise
comparison can systematically fail to even present real retries to the semantic
arbiter (pairs late in a video were less likely to ever be proposed, independent of
how obvious a retry they were); pairwise discovery with a fixed top-K is therefore not
the fundamental retry-family-discovery mechanism -- `take_grouping_provider.py`'s
candidate-pair generation now ranks eligible pairs by priority (temporal proximity,
raw lexical overlap, continuation/restart evidence) before spending the batch budget,
rather than truncating in enumeration order.

Active pipeline: ASR/aligned speech timeline -> Watch+Listen evidence -> attempt
reconstruction -> idea/intent clustering (lexical tier + bounded `semantic_idea_
equivalence` arbiter tier) -> delivery completeness + performance-quality competition
(`take_judge.rank_takes`) -> `deterministic_best_take_authority` (KEEP/DISCARD, SWAP
out of scope per D-019) -> composite resolution when genuinely required -> `final_
story_coherence_validation` (residual-ambiguity resolution via the same bounded
arbiter, missing-story-ending observability) -> KEEP/DISCARD final membership ->
Selection Freeze -> Boundary/Microtrim. Gemini is never the primary editor; it is a
bounded semantic arbiter only, reused at two points (idea clustering, final coherence
ambiguity) rather than the single whole-video SELECT/SWAP/DISCARD reasoner call, which
is deactivated in the active path (rollback: `CUTSELL_CLEAN_CUT_CORE_V1=0`).

`final_story_coherence_validation.py` additionally enforces two hard pre-Freeze
invariants, both deterministic and evidence-based (no new heuristic invented): the
**contradiction invariant** (two still-co-selected members of the same retry family
that disagree on a number or an explicit negation are factually incompatible, not
alternate phrasings -- reuses `final_sibling_grouping.py`'s own `_numbers`/
`_negations` extractors) and the **idea coverage invariant** (a retry-family group
with zero surviving selected members means that intended idea vanished from the
winning edit entirely). Either sets `freeze_blocked=True` in diagnostics;
`universal_clean_cut.py` checks this and skips Selection Freeze/Boundary entirely
rather than let a self-contradictory or idea-incomplete draft reach Freeze --
Boundary never gets the chance to paper over a semantic membership mistake.

Not yet implemented in V1, documented as a known gap rather than silently absent:
exhaustive unique-fact-loss detection beyond the number/negation contradiction check,
general (non-numeric/non-negation) factual contradiction, and full integration of
`hybrid_composite_best_take.py`'s dedicated composite-reconciliation machinery into
the idea-first chain (composite resolution today relies on genuinely different ideas
never being forced into competition in the first place, per the "continuation must
not collapse" invariant) -- see D-021's CompositeResolver row.

## D-021 — Canonical Clean Cut Core V1 component map
**Status: CANONICAL**

The canonical engine converges toward 11 responsibilities. Every active behavior in
the Clean Cut Core V1 path (`clean_cut_core_v1_enabled=True`, the default) maps to
exactly one, so there is one owner per responsibility rather than several semantic
brains rewriting the same membership sequentially:

| Canonical component | Current code | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| AttemptReconstructor | `attempt_reconstruction.py` (`reconstruct_delivery_attempts`) | KEEP AS CORE |
| IdeaClusterer | `take_grouping_provider.py` (`safe_group_takes` lexical tier + `reconcile_semantic_idea_equivalence` bounded semantic tier, priority-ranked candidate pairs per D-020); `take_grouping.py` (`retry_similarity`/`semantic_key`) | KEEP AS CORE / MERGED |
| RetryFamilyResolver | The resolved groups IdeaClusterer produces ARE the retry families. `final_sibling_grouping.py`, `global_session_sibling_bridge.py`, `session_boundaries.py` contribute merge evidence/session partitioning into that same result | DEMOTE TO EVIDENCE (feed IdeaClusterer's output, not a separate invoked step) |
| DeliveryScorer | `take_judge.py` (`score_take`/`rank_takes`) | KEEP AS CORE |
| BestTakeResolver | `deterministic_best_take_authority.py` | KEEP AS CORE / PROMOTED (Phase 1) |
| SemanticArbiter | `semantic_idea_equivalence.py` + `semantic_idea_equivalence_google.py` | KEEP AS CORE, bounded role only (D-020) |
| CompositeResolver | `hybrid_composite_best_take.py`, `post_selection_complementary_family_stabilizer.py` | DEMOTE TO EVIDENCE / PARTIAL -- reachable in the active V1 path (see the `editorial_judge` starvation fix below), and functionally sound: it identifies composite-worthy pieces and marks them via a context-var (`_COMPOSITE_SPLIT_IDS`) that a second wrap forces into singleton groups BEFORE grouping runs, so BestTakeResolver's one-winner competition structurally cannot collapse them again -- the same outcome the canonical pipeline's post-Best-Take composite step describes, achieved by pre-emptive exclusion rather than post-hoc reconstruction. Still a known gap in NAME/DIRECTNESS only: it is two chained monkeypatch wraps over `apply_hybrid_session_cleanup`/`safe_group_takes_by_sessions` rather than one directly-callable step in `universal_clean_cut.py`'s V1 sequence. Its decisions surface in `diagnostics.hybrid_editorial_chunks` (now printed in CI, see D-020's observability note) |
| StoryValidator | `final_story_coherence_validation.py` | KEEP AS CORE (new; folds alternates to discard, resolves residual ambiguity via SemanticArbiter, contradiction invariant, idea-coverage invariant, hard pre-Freeze gate via `freeze_blocked`) |
| SelectionFreeze | `selection_boundary_contract.py` (`freeze_selection_contract`/`enforce_selection_contract`) | KEEP AS CORE, unchanged |
| BoundaryEngine | `final_boundary_authority.py`, `human_boundary_polish_v5.py`, speech-safe/microtrim guards | KEEP AS CORE, physical-only, unchanged. Also satisfies the canonical directive's audio/visual pacing QA requirement: `human_boundary_polish_v5.py` already consolidates the dead-air/reset pacing work older v1-v4 passes mixed with Selection responsibilities, using multimodal reset evidence (`_reset_score`/`_micro_reset_evidence`, reused from v2) rather than naive silence-length deletion, and is Boundary-only by construction. No new pacing module was built; pacing *quality* (as opposed to architecture) still needs empirical validation via Human Watch+Listen. |
| Renderer | `render_plan.py`/`render.py` | KEEP AS CORE, unchanged (renders `selected` only, never `alternates`) |

Reused as BestTakeResolver's own upstream input in the active path (not a parallel
authority): `selection_phase_authority.py`, `selection_conflicted_bridge_guard.py`
(Hybrid-vote-informed reconciliation, unchanged, now feeding into
`deterministic_best_take_authority` rather than being a competing final say).

DEPRECATED FROM ACTIVE PATH (kept only behind `clean_cut_core_v1_enabled=False` for
rollback, per D-019/D-020): `unified_selection_reasoner.py`, `unified_selection_google.py`
(the whole-video SELECT/SWAP/DISCARD reasoner).

KEPT AS SAFETY/ROLLBACK INFRASTRUCTURE (dormant, not deleted, per D-019):
`deterministic_best_take_authority.py`'s `swap_enabled` parameter;
`draft_edits.py`'s `swap_take` (a different, manual editor-layer product surface,
never part of this decision).

## Change rule

When a new decision changes product behavior, update this file in the same development cycle. Do not silently redefine CutSell through code alone.
